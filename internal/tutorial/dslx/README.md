# Tutorial: using the dslx API for writing OONI experiments

Welcome to the tutorial for writing OONI network tests using dslx!
We introduced dslx with the idea to make writing OONI experiments easier because you won't have to deal with any bureaucracy related to measuring.

Index:

- [chapter01](chapter01) shows you the general principle of dslx based on some examples.
- [chapter02](chapter02) is the main part of this tutorial. You will learn how to re-implement an existing OONI Probe experiment (SNI blocking) using dslx.
- [chapter03](chapter03) shows you how to run dslx measurements in parallel.



If you encounter problems with using dslx or this tutorial, please let us know. We appreciate any feedback to make dslx as community-friendly as possible.
