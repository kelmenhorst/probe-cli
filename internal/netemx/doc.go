// Package netemx contains ooni/netem adapters. This code could have been part
// of the [netxlite] package, but we keep it separate such that you do not link
// with [netem] unless you need to use [netem] (presumably for testing).

// To understand how to use this package for integration testing, please check
// how we implemented testing for this package.
